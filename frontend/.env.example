# For development: Use relative path '/api' to leverage Vite proxy (recommended)
# For production: MUST be set to full backend API URL (e.g., https://api.legendsascend.com/api or https://your-backend.vercel.app/api)
# IMPORTANT: Production deployments will fail without a valid VITE_API_URL pointing to your deployed backend
VITE_API_URL=/api
