# API Configuration
# CRITICAL: This MUST be configured correctly for production deployments
#
# For LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
# Use '/api' to leverage Vite's proxy (recommended for local dev)
VITE_API_URL=/api
#
# For PRODUCTION (Vercel, etc.):
# This MUST be set in your deployment platform's environment variables
# (NOT in this file - this file is only for local development)
# Example values:
#   VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.vercel.app/api
#   VITE_API_URL=https://api.legendsascend.com/api
#
# ⚠️ DEPLOYMENT WARNING:
# If you see 405 errors in production, VITE_API_URL is not configured.
# See DEPLOYMENT.md section "Troubleshooting > Subscription API returns 405 error"

# Landing Page Configuration
VITE_LANDING_PAGE_ENABLED=true
