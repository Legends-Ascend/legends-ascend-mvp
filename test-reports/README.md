# Test Reports

This folder contains comprehensive testing reports generated by the Legends Ascend QA testing agents during the development cycle.

## Purpose

Test reports document the testing of features, user stories, and PRs to ensure quality, compliance, and Definition of Done requirements are met before code is merged to main branch.

## Folder Structure

```
test-reports/
├── README.md (this file)
├── PR-{PR_NUMBER}-TEST-REPORT.md
├── US-{USER_STORY_ID}-TEST-REPORT.md
└── archived/
    └── Historical test reports
```

## File Naming Convention

All testing agents **MUST** use the following naming convention for test reports:

- **For Pull Requests:** `PR-{NUMBER}-TEST-REPORT.md`
  - Example: `PR-72-TEST-REPORT.md`
  - Format: PR number extracted from GitHub PR URL

- **For User Stories:** `US-{ID}-TEST-REPORT.md`
  - Example: `US-002-TEST-REPORT.md`
  - Format: Zero-padded 3-digit ID from user story tracking

- **For Features/Components:** `FEATURE-{NAME}-TEST-REPORT.md`
  - Example: `FEATURE-AUTH-SYSTEM-TEST-REPORT.md`
  - Format: Uppercase with hyphens separating words

## Report Location

**All test reports MUST be saved to the `/test-reports/` folder.**

Test reports should NEVER be placed in:
- Repository root directory
- `/docs/` folder
- Feature/component folders
- Any other location outside `/test-reports/`

## Report Contents

Each test report should include:

1. **Header Information**
   - Test title and reference (PR/US/Feature)
   - Test date
   - Testing agent name
   - Overall status (APPROVED FOR MERGE / NEEDS FIXES / BLOCKED)

2. **Executive Summary**
   - Overview of what was tested
   - Key findings
   - Recommendation

3. **Test Categories**
   - Functional Testing
   - Acceptance Criteria Verification
   - Code Quality Checks
   - Performance/Security
   - Compliance & Standards

4. **Detailed Findings**
   - Test cases with results
   - Issues found (if any)
   - Evidence/screenshots

5. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of pass/fail rate
   - Blocking issues (if any)
   - Recommendations for merge

## Access & Archiving

- Active test reports: Stored in `/test-reports/` root
- Historical reports (>30 days old): Should be moved to `/test-reports/archived/`
- All reports are readable by the development team
- Reports are used for sprint reviews and quality metrics

## Guidelines for Testing Agents

1. **Always save to `/test-reports/` folder** - Never use root directory
2. **Use correct naming convention** - Report must be identifiable by filename
3. **Include all required sections** - Don't abbreviate critical information
4. **Link to relevant resources** - Reference PR, user story, issues, commits
5. **Provide clear recommendations** - Make merge decision obvious
6. **Date all reports** - Include test date in YYYY-MM-DD format
7. **Mark issues clearly** - Use checkmarks, status badges, risk indicators
