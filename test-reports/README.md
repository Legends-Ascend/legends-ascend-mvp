# Test Reports

This folder contains comprehensive testing reports generated by the Legends Ascend QA testing agents during the development cycle.

## Purpose

Test reports document the testing of features, user stories, and PRs to ensure quality, compliance, and Definition of Done requirements are met before code is merged to main branch.

## Folder Structure

```
test-reports/
├── README.md (this file)
├── PR-{PR_NUMBER}-TEST-REPORT.md
├── US-{USER_STORY_ID}-TEST-REPORT.md
└── archived/
    └── Historical test reports
```

## File Naming Convention

All testing agents **MUST** use the following naming convention for test reports:

- **For Pull Requests:** `PR-{NUMBER}-TEST-REPORT.md`
  - Example: `PR-72-TEST-REPORT.md`
  - Format: PR number extracted from GitHub PR URL

- **For User Stories:** `US-{ID}-TEST-REPORT.md`
  - Example: `US-002-TEST-REPORT.md`
  - Format: Zero-padded 3-digit ID from user story tracking

- **For Features/Components:** `FEATURE-{NAME}-TEST-REPORT.md`
  - Example: `FEATURE-AUTH-SYSTEM-TEST-REPORT.md`
  - Format: Uppercase with hyphens separating words

## Report Location

**All test reports MUST be saved to the `/test-reports/` folder.**

Test reports should NEVER be placed in:
- Repository root directory
- `/docs/` folder
- Feature/component folders
- Any other location outside `/test-reports/`

## Report Contents

Each test report should include:

1. **Header Information**
   - Test title and reference (PR/US/Feature)
   - Test date
   - Testing agent name
   - Overall status (APPROVED FOR MERGE / NEEDS FIXES / BLOCKED)

2. **Executive Summary**
   - Overview of what was tested
   - Key findings
   - Recommendation

3. **Test Categories**
   - Functional Testing
   - Acceptance Criteria Verification
   - Code Quality Checks
   - Performance/Security
   - Compliance & Standards

4. **Detailed Findings**
   - Test cases with results
   - Issues found (if any)
   - Evidence/screenshots

5. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of pass/fail rate
   - Blocking issues (if any)
   - Recommendations for merge

## Access & Archiving

- Active test reports: Stored in `/test-reports/` root
- Historical reports (>30 days old): Should be moved to `/test-reports/archived/`
- All reports are readable by the development team
- Reports are used for sprint reviews and quality metrics

## Guidelines for Testing Agents

1. **Always save to `/test-reports/` folder** - Never use root directory
2. **Use correct naming convention** - Report must be identifiable by filename
3. **Include all required sections** - Don't abbreviate critical information
4. **Link to relevant resources** - Reference PR, user story, issues, commits
5. **Provide clear recommendations** - Make merge decision obvious
6. **Date all reports** - Include test date in YYYY-MM-DD format
7. **Mark issues clearly** - Use checkmarks, status badges, risk indicators

## MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS FOR TEST AGENTS

### All Test Agents MUST Follow These Rules:

**1. ALWAYS save test files to `/test-reports` folder**
   - Never save test outputs, reports, logs, or summaries to the root directory
   - Use this path: `./test-reports/[filename].md` or `./test-reports/[filename].txt`
   - Example: `./test-reports/PR-125-TESTING-REPORT.md` NOT `./PR-125-TESTING-REPORT.md`

**2. File Location Enforcement**
   - GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Databricks agents, and all AI testing tools
   - Write ALL test outputs to `/test-reports/` exclusively
   - The root directory is reserved for core project files only

**3. Naming Convention for Test Output Files**
   - Format: `PR-[NUMBER]-[TEST-TYPE]-[DATE].md`
   - Example: `PR-125-INTEGRATION-TEST-2025-11-19.md`
   - Always include the PR number, test type, and date
   - Use uppercase with hyphens for readability

**4. Automatic Organization**
   - When test reports accumulate (>30 days old):
     - Create folder: `./test-reports/archived/`
     - Move old reports there with naming: `[ORIGINAL-NAME]-archived-[DATE].md`
     - Keep current reports at root of test-reports

**5. What Constitutes Test Output (MUST go to `/test-reports`)**
   - ✅ Validation reports
   - ✅ Test execution summaries
   - ✅ DoD (Definition of Done) checklists
   - ✅ Test results and findings
   - ✅ Performance reports
   - ✅ Coverage reports
   - ✅ Bug findings and logs
   - ✅ Any generated output from test runs

**6. What Does NOT Go to `/test-reports`**
   - ❌ Technical documentation (goes to `/docs`)
   - ❌ Deployment guides (goes to `/docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`)
   - ❌ Code changes and source files (go to respective folders)
   - ❌ Configuration files (stay at root or appropriate folder)

**7. Commit Message Format**
   - Always use: `docs: Add [FILENAME] to test-reports - [Brief Description]`
   - Example: `docs: Add PR-125-INTEGRATION-TEST-2025-11-19.md to test-reports - Complete integration testing validation`

**8. Compliance Check**
   - Before committing any test output, verify:
     - ✓ File is in `test-reports/` folder
     - ✓ Filename follows naming convention
     - ✓ File contains test data, not technical docs
     - ✓ Commit message references test-reports path

### Why This Matters:

- **Clean Repository Structure**: Keeps the root clean for project essentials only
- **Easy Access**: All test results are in one organized location
- **Historical Tracking**: Easy to review testing progress over time
- **Archive Management**: Old reports don't clutter active test results
- **CI/CD Integration**: Test agents can automatically place outputs in the right location
